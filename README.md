# Doctor's appointment manager

This code is written within the framework of a study course, a homework.


Note 1: os.system commands work well on windows systems but are untested on other platforms.

Note 2: The bribe system is designed to work for patients with unique data, but it may not be able to exclude patients with ambiguous data. In previous versions, I limited the selection of patients based on their ID, which would have been the only truly unique data if the code had been restricted to a single column of data. However, since the assignment requires to be able to identify patients using any data provided, I have adapted the system to accommodate this requirement.
